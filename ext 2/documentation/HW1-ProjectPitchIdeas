Pitch Ideas:

Idea #1: Study Partner Finder App

This would be a program where students can find and match with other students in their classes or fields of study. They can import their class schedule and their google calendar into a database, which will show to other users with the same availability in the same subject. They will be able to choose what subject they are looking for a study partner for, as well as set settings for how often they want to study: before the test, weekly review, etc. Users would log in to FaceBook for third-party authentication. APIs we might use: Google Calendar and Facebook

Idea #2: Common App for Jobs

This would be a web extension that stores user application information in a database, which can be easily uploaded to different job applications. It would make applying for multiple jobs much easier for the user, as they wouldn’t have to input the same information every time they apply for a job. Users would log into LinkedIn for third-party authentication, which could also provide some applicant information to the database. APIs we might use: Indeed and LinkedIn
