For our application, we are using PyMongo, a tool used for working with MongoDB in Python.

This is the code we plan on implementing to store values from our API into our database, and retrieving information from the database to supply to users.

from flask import Flask
from flask.ext.pymongo import PyMongo

app = Flask(__name__)

app.config['MONGO_DBNAME'] = 'connect_to_mongo'
#app.config['MONGO_URI'] = 

mongo = PyMongo(app)

@app.route('/add')
def add():
	user = mongo.db.users
	user.insert({'company' : 'Google', ‘position’: ‘Software Engineer’, ‘location’: ‘Boston’})
	return 'Added User!'

@app.route('/find')
def find():
	user = mongo.db.users
	found = user.find_one({company' : 'Google'})
	return 'You found ' + found['company']

if __name__ == '__main__':
	app.run(debug=True)

As we can see, the JSON schema will follow the format of {'company' , ‘position’, ‘location’} but we will use the company name as the key. The only required field is the company name.
