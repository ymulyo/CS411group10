As a user, I want to be able to use my existing LinkedIn account to import data into the database.

Our app will give users the option to log in with LinkedIn, and then after they log in, it will ask them if they would like to import their data or not. 
In the case that they choose to import their data, and the data imports into the wrong fields, they can manually fix the errors.
