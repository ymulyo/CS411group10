# CS411group10
CS411 project for group 10

Directions to find files - 
Our main folder is named "ext 2", inside that is all the code required for the final app. 
We have a lot of "testing folders" please ignore those.
The final project report is in the main page because the folder as a whole is required to be loaded into the extension area for google chrome, and cannot be tampered with. 

Pitch Ideas:

Idea #1: Study Partner Finder App

This would be a program where students can find and match with other students in their classes or fields of study. They can import their class schedule and their google calendar into a database, which will show to other users with the same availability in the same subject. They will be able to choose what subject they are looking for a study partner for, as well as set settings for how often they want to study: before the test, weekly review, etc. Users would log in to FaceBook for third-party authentication. 
  APIs we might use:
    Google Calendar and Facebook

Idea #2: Common App for Jobs

This would be a web extension that stores user application information in a database, which can be easily uploaded to different job applications. It would make applying for multiple jobs much easier for the user, as they wouldnâ€™t have to input the same information every time they apply for a job. Users would log into LinkedIn for third-party authentication, which could also provide some applicant information to the database.
  APIs we might use:
    Indeed and LinkedIn
