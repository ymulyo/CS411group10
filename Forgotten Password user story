As a user who forgot my password, I would like to change it.

Our app will output a “forgot password?” message with the option to click on it, where users can input their email so the app
can send them a validation link. They will click on this link, and reset their password. If someone inputs an invalid email, 
they will not get the validation code. In the case that they input another user’s email, the other user’s password will not be 
reset unless they click on the link.
